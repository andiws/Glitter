# Glitter
Jose, Baldwin, Dulce, Andi

Lessons Learned: 
A fork contains a branch
The sooner you start the better
Apples to oranges 
Requirements of the project:

1. Must use node.js

2. Must be more complicated than "Hello World"

3. Must using unit testing for node.js

4. Must be able to show RESTful with POSTMAN, but feel free to also create a front end and do other stuff (edited)

5. Don’t forget the point is the have an api backend hosted by node.js!

Solidify these points: 

Express is a WEB SERVER 
postman is a type of client  
REST is a architectural design- soap or rest; think crud

Project Process: 
Open new project 
Node has been installed, npm is magically there as well 
Npm init to create package.json 
[add to script in p.jason]
Npm init -s to save 
Npm init -s express 
Create server.js file
